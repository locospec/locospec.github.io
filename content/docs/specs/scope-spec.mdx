title: Scope Spec
description: Reusable named filters for models, used across views, actions, and queries.
---

**Scopes** allow you to define reusable, named filters inside a **Model Spec**. These filters can be referenced in views, queries, or actions to avoid repeating the same logic multiple times.

They make it easy to define common business rules like:

- `"active"` users
- `"verified"` accounts
- `"inProgress"` workflows

---

## 🔧 Basic Structure

```json
"scopes": {
  "active": {
    "op": "and",
    "conditions": [
      { "attribute": "status", "op": "is", "value": "active" }
    ]
  },
  "verified": {
    "op": "and",
    "conditions": [
      { "attribute": "verified", "op": "is", "value": true }
    ]
  }
}
```

Each key under `scopes` is the name of the scope and its value is a **filter group**, just like the filter syntax used in actions.

---

## ✅ Filter Syntax Supported

Scopes use the same flexible filter definition as all Locospec filters:

- Filter Groups (with `op: and/or`)
- Flat arrays of conditions
- Shorthand key-value maps

> See [Filter Schema](/specifications/filters) for full details.

---

## 📌 Where Scopes Are Used

- In **View Specs** (as part of filters or default conditions)
- In **Select actions** using the `scopes` key
- In **Context-resolved filters** where reusable logic is needed

---

## 🧪 Example: Full Usage in Model Spec

```json
{
  "name": "user",
  "type": "model",
  "label": "User",
  "config": { ... },
  "attributes": { ... },
  "scopes": {
    "active": {
      "op": "and",
      "conditions": [
        { "attribute": "status", "op": "is", "value": "active" }
      ]
    },
    "adminOnly": {
      "op": "and",
      "conditions": [
        { "attribute": "role", "op": "is", "value": "admin" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔁 Combining with Filters

You can apply a scope and also pass additional filters. The scope becomes the **base**, and your filters layer on top.
