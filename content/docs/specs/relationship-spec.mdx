title: Relationship Spec
description: Define model associations using hasOne, hasMany, belongsTo, and more.
---

The `relationships` section in a **Model Spec** defines how your model is connected to other models. These associations power **expansions**, **filtering across models**, and **relational dropdowns** in forms.

Relationships are declared explicitly and support standard types like:

- `has_one`
- `has_many`
- `belongs_to`

---

## ðŸ”§ Basic Structure

```json
"relationships": {
  "has_many": {
    "posts": {
      "model": "post",
      "foreignKey": "user_uuid",
      "localKey": "uuid"
    }
  },
  "belongs_to": {
    "role": {
      "model": "role",
      "foreignKey": "role_id",
      "ownerKey": "uuid"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## ðŸ§­ Relationship Types

### ðŸ§© `has_many`

Represents a **one-to-many** relationship.

```json
"has_many": {
  "posts": {
    "model": "post",
    "foreignKey": "user_uuid",
    "localKey": "uuid"
  }
}
```

- This means: A user has many posts.
- `foreignKey` is on the child (`post.user_uuid`)
- `localKey` is on the parent (`user.uuid`)

---

### ðŸ§© `has_one`

Represents a **one-to-one** relationship.

```json
"has_one": {
  "profile": {
    "model": "profile",
    "foreignKey": "user_uuid",
    "localKey": "uuid"
  }
}
```

> Same structure as `has_many`, but for singular relation.

---

### ðŸ§² `belongs_to`

Represents an **inverse relationship**, where the current model belongs to another.

```json
"belongs_to": {
  "role": {
    "model": "role",
    "foreignKey": "role_id",
    "ownerKey": "uuid"
  }
}
```

- `foreignKey` is on the current model (`user.role_id`)
- `ownerKey` is on the related model (`role.uuid`)

---

## ðŸ§  Why Explicit Relationships?

- They enable `expand` functionality in **Views** and **Entities**
- They power **related dropdowns** in forms (like selecting a city for a user)
- They allow building **cross-model filters and queries**
- They define **directional joins** for internal engine resolution

## ðŸ§ª Example: Complete Relationship Block

```json
"relationships": {
  "has_one": {
    "profile": {
      "model": "profile",
      "foreignKey": "user_uuid",
      "localKey": "uuid"
    }
  },
  "has_many": {
    "orders": {
      "model": "order",
      "foreignKey": "user_id",
      "localKey": "id"
    }
  },
  "belongs_to": {
    "company": {
      "model": "company",
      "foreignKey": "company_id",
      "ownerKey": "uuid"
    }
  }
}
```

## ðŸ”Ž Where Relationships Are Used

- **expand** in View & Entity Specs
- **Mutators** for dynamic dropdowns and contextual forms
- **Select/Filters** for deep querying across models
- **Generators** (e.g. referencing related values or backfilling)
