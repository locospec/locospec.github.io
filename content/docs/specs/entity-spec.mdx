title: Entity Spec
description: Define how a single record should be displayed using layout sections and nested fields.
---

The **Entity Spec** defines how a **single record** of a model should be presented—think detail pages, summary cards, or read-only views. It focuses entirely on layout: grouping, nesting, and arranging fields into readable sections.

Unlike Views, which render collections, **Entity Specs render one record at a time**.

## 🧩 Basic Structure

```json
{
    "name": "user_detail",
    "type": "entity",
    "label": "User Detail",
    "model": "user",
    "expand": ["role"],
    "layout": [
        [
            "$ User Info"
            ["$Basic Info", "name", "email"],
            ["$Contact Info", "phone", "address"],
            ["$Company Info", "company.name", "company.website"]
        ]
    ]
}
```

## ⚙️ Required Fields

| Field    | Type       | Description                                |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `name`   | string     | Unique name of the entity spec             |
| `type`   | `"entity"` | Must always be `"entity"`                  |
| `label`  | string     | Human-readable name for UI                 |
| `model`  | string     | Name of the associated model spec          |
| `layout` | array      | Layout definition for rendering the fields |

---

## 🔄 `expand`

Declare which **related models** to load when rendering this entity.

```json
"expand": ["role", "profile.city"]
```

- Enables fields like `role.name` or `profile.city.name` to be accessible and displayed
- Must match relationships defined in the model spec

---

## 🧱 `layout`

The `layout` field defines how to visually arrange fields when displaying a **single record**. It supports:

- Sections (`$Header`)
- Grouped fields (rows)
- Column-based layouts
- Nested relationships (e.g., `company.name`)

Each item in the layout array can be:

- A **section header** (starts with `$`)
- A **row of fields** (array)
- A **nested array of rows and sections** for full control

### Example:

```json
"layout": [
    [
        "$ User Info"
        ["$Basic Info", "name", "email"],
        ["$Contact Info", "phone", "address"],
        ["$Company Info", "company.name", "company.website"]
    ]
]
```

This defines:

- A single row section titled **User Info**
- Three **columns** inside that row:

  - Column 1: labeled **Basic Info** → shows `name`, `email`
  - Column 2: labeled **Contact Info** → shows `phone`, `address`
  - Column 3: labeled **Company Info** → shows `company.name`, `company.website`

- Support for **nested relationships** via dot notation

> 🧠 Layout is intentionally renderer-agnostic—it works whether you're rendering in cards, tabs, rows, or columns.
