# 📚 Glossary

A reference list of key concepts and terms used across the Locospec ecosystem.

---

## 🔖 Spec

A **Spec** is a JSON definition that describes the structure and behavior of data, views, or actions in Locospec. Specs are used to generate APIs, forms, filters, tables, and more.

---

## 🗃 Model Spec

Defines the structure of a database entity. It includes attributes (fields), relationships, scopes, aliases, and optional config for soft deletes, primary keys, etc.

---

## 📊 View Spec

Describes how a collection of records should be displayed and queried. Includes filters, pagination, sorts, and table/list/kanban-style views.

---

## 📇 Entity Spec

Defines how a **single record** should be displayed using a sectioned layout. Typically used for detail pages, profile views, or cards.

---

## ⚙️ Mutator Spec

A declarative form specification for **creating, updating, or deleting** a record. Includes generators, validations, layout schema, and UI schema.

---

## 🔁 Action Spec

A low-level DB operation spec like `insert`, `update`, `delete`, or `select`. Typically used internally by mutators and views.

---

## 🧱 Attributes

Define the fields of a model or mutator. Includes type, label, generation rules, and validations. Can also be used to configure file inputs, JSON fields, and relationships.

---

## 🔍 Filters

Declarative logic for querying data. Can be simple (`{ key: value }`) or deeply nested with logical groups (`and`, `or`) and multiple operators like `is`, `contains`, etc.

---

## 🧠 Scopes

Reusable named filters defined at the model level. These can be referenced in views, mutators, or queries.

---

## 🪄 Aliases

Virtual fields that derive their value from other fields or relationships using `source` or `transform`. Helpful for exposing related values or computed fields.

---

## 🔐 Permissions

Access control at the spec level. If a user has access to a spec (model, view, entity, mutator), they can use it. Permissions are declared inline via `"permissions": ["read", "update"]`.

---

## 🗂 Registry

The runtime system that loads, validates, and caches specs. There is a PHP registry and a TS registry, both capable of validating against schema standards.

---

## 🔄 State Machine

Used in advanced mutators or generators, the state machine enables conditional logic and data flow orchestration, similar to AWS Step Functions.

---

## 🧩 JSON Schema

The formal structure used to validate specs. Locospec follows [JSON Schema Draft 07](https://json-schema.org) to enforce structure and type safety.

---

## 🚀 Rocket

A project scaffolding CLI/tool that connects to your database, reads structure, and auto-generates Locospec-compatible specs (model, view, entity, etc.).

---

## 🪪 Expand

A way to declare which **relationships** should be resolved and included when querying data. Used in Views, Entities, and Select Actions.

---

## 🖼 Display Modes

Used in view specs to determine how data should be rendered — e.g., `table`, `list`, `kanban`, or `single`.
