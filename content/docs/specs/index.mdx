> “Specs are the new code. Write once, power everything.”

Welcome to **Locospec Standard Specifications**—the foundation of how we build, describe, and extend data-driven systems using nothing but JSON.

Locospec is a **spec-first, low-code framework** designed to make building internal tools, admin panels, and workflows as easy as writing configuration. But not just any config—**typed, validated, reusable JSON specs** that double as documentation and triple as API contracts.

## 🔍 What Is a Locospec?

At its core, a **Locospec** is a JSON document that tells the system:

- What data looks like (`model`)
- How it should be displayed (`view`, `entity`)
- How it can be mutated (`mutator`, `action`)
- How users can search, filter, and interact (`filters`, `scopes`)
- Who can see or do what (`permissions`)

No more stitching logic across backend controllers and frontend UI. With Locospec, the spec is the single source of truth—**one file, many powers**.

## 🧠 Why Have a Spec Standard?

In a growing codebase, it’s easy for logic to scatter:

- Backend handles validation, but frontend repeats it
- DB knows relationships, but UI guesses it
- Mutations are manual, brittle, and hard to test

**Locospec fixes this with a shared spec schema**—standardized, engine-agnostic, and runtime-neutral. This schema powers everything from:

✅ CRUD APIs  
✅ Tables & Forms  
✅ Filter Builders  
✅ Mutator State Machines  
✅ Validation Rules  
✅ Permission Checks  
✅ Even AI-powered spec tooling

## 🧠 How Locospec Works

Locospec is built on a composable spec system. Developers define **models**, and layer on **views**, **entities**, and **mutators**. Everything is declared in JSON specs.

These specs are loaded and executed by the **Engine**, which powers:

- Fully searchable tables, lists, and kanbans
- Detail views like cards or summaries
- Forms with validations, state machines, and generators
- Deep filtering and cross-model queries
- Auto-generated CRUD APIs

## 🧱 What You’ll Learn in This Section

This section is your spec bible. You’ll find the **complete JSON schema** for each spec type and learn how to:

- Declare models and attributes
- Describe relationships and filters
- Create reusable lenses and forms
- Add validations, generators, and layout metadata

No implementation details. Just the **contract** between your mind and the machine.

## 🧩 Supported Spec Types

| Spec Type | Purpose                                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `model`   | Defines data structure, fields, and relationships                        |
| `view`    | Declares how to query and display collections of data                    |
| `entity`  | Structures how to show a single record (e.g., detail view, summary card) |
| `mutator` | Describes form layouts and mutation input                                |
| `action`  | Direct DB operations like insert/update/delete                           |
| `filters` | Declarative query logic with nested conditions                           |
| `scopes`  | Predefined filters for dynamic views (e.g. `only_published`)             |

## 🚀 DX-First, Always

- **Write once**: A single spec can power backend APIs, frontend components, and dev tools.
- **Type-safe**: All specs follow [JSON Schema v7](https://json-schema.org/specification.html), and you can validate them before shipping.
- **Composable**: Specs reference other specs. Build your system like LEGO bricks.
- **Future-proof**: Specs can be versioned, synced, and rolled back anytime.
