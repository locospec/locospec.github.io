Welcome to the Locospec Engine implementation guide! This guide will help you understand the core concepts and architecture needed to implement the Locospec engine in any programming language.

## üìã What is Locospec Engine?

Locospec Engine is a specification-driven runtime that executes JSON-based definitions to build data-driven applications. The engine is designed to be language-agnostic, allowing implementations in any programming language while maintaining consistent behavior and compatibility.

## üéØ Core Concepts

### 1. Spec-First Architecture

The engine follows a spec-first approach where:

- All functionality is defined through JSON specifications
- Specs are the single source of truth
- Runtime behavior is determined by spec interpretation
- No hard-coded business logic

### 2. Component-Based Design

The engine is built around these core components:

#### Registry

- Central storage for all specs
- Handles spec loading and validation
- Manages spec relationships and dependencies
- Provides runtime access to specs

#### State Machine

- Executes workflow definitions
- Handles conditional logic
- Manages state transitions
- Processes data transformations

#### Query Builder

- Translates filter specs into database queries
- Handles relationship resolution
- Manages query optimization
- Supports various database backends

## üé® Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Language Requirements

Your implementation should:

- Support JSON parsing and manipulation
- Handle async operations
- Provide type safety (if applicable)
- Support error handling
- Include testing capabilities

### 2. Core Features

Must implement:

- Spec validation against JSON Schema
- Relationship resolution
- Filter translation
- State machine execution
- Permission checking
- Error handling

### 3. Extension Points

Should support:

- Custom validators
- Database adapters
- Authentication providers
- Cache implementations
- Custom transformers

## üìö Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Project Structure**

   ```
   /src
     /core
       registry.ts
       state-machine.ts
       query-builder.ts
     /specs
       model.ts
       view.ts
       mutator.ts
     /utils
       validation.ts
       transformation.ts
   ```

2. **Implement Core Interfaces**

   - Start with the Registry
   - Add State Machine
   - Implement Query Builder
   - Add utility functions

3. **Add Spec Support**

   - Model spec implementation
   - View spec implementation
   - Mutator spec implementation
   - Filter spec implementation

4. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Unit tests for each component
   - Integration tests
   - Spec validation tests
   - Performance benchmarks

## üîç Next Steps

1. Read the [Filter Implementation Guide](/docs/guide/filters) for detailed class diagrams and implementation details
2. Review the [Spec Schema Documentation](/docs/specs) for complete spec definitions
3. Check the [Contributing Guidelines](/docs/contributing) for development standards
4. Join the [Community](/community) to discuss implementation details
