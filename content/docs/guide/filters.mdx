## üèóÔ∏è Core Components

### 1. FilterInterface

The base interface that all filter types must implement:

- Defines the contract for converting filters to array representation
- Ensures consistent serialization across all filter types
- Enables polymorphic handling of different filter types

### 2. Condition

Represents a single filter condition:

- Stores attribute name, operator, and value
- Implements basic comparison operations
- Provides immutable access to its properties
- Converts to array format for serialization

### 3. FilterGroup

Handles logical grouping of conditions:

- Supports AND/OR operations between conditions
- Can contain nested conditions and groups
- Provides methods for adding new conditions
- Maintains operator type and condition list

### 4. PrimitiveFilterSet

Simplifies basic key-value filters:

- Stores simple attribute-value pairs
- Useful for basic equality conditions
- Provides easy addition of new filters
- Converts to standard filter format

### 5. Filters

The main entry point for filter operations:

- Manages the root filter element
- Provides static factory methods
- Supports filter merging
- Handles array conversion

## üîÑ Resolvers

### 1. ContextResolver

Resolves dynamic values in filters:

- Processes context variables in filter values
- Handles nested context resolution
- Maintains context state
- Resolves all filter types

### 2. AliasResolver

Manages attribute aliases:

- Maps alias names to actual attributes
- Supports complex alias patterns
- Resolves aliases in all filter types
- Maintains alias definitions

### 3. RelationshipResolver

Handles relationship-based filters:

- Resolves filters across related models
- Manages database operations for relationships
- Uses registry for model definitions
- Extracts and points to relationship attributes

## üé® Implementation Approach

### 1. Base Structure

1. Implement the `FilterInterface`
2. Create the operator enumerations
3. Build the core filter classes
4. Implement the resolver classes

### 2. Filter Building

```plaintext
1. Start with Filters class
2. Use static factory methods
3. Build conditions or groups
4. Add to filter structure
```

### 3. Resolution Process

```plaintext
1. Create resolver instances
2. Pass filters through resolvers
3. Handle context/alias/relationship resolution
4. Return resolved filters
```

## üìù Usage Examples

### 1. Simple Condition

```plaintext
Filters::condition('status', ComparisonOperator::IS, 'active')
```

### 2. Complex Group

```plaintext
Filters::group(LogicalOperator::AND)
    ->add(Filters::condition('status', ComparisonOperator::IS, 'active'))
    ->add(Filters::condition('type', ComparisonOperator::IN, ['user', 'admin']))
```

### 3. With Context

```plaintext
$context = ['user_id' => 123];
$resolver = new ContextResolver($context);
$filters = Filters::condition('created_by', ComparisonOperator::IS, '{user_id}');
$resolved = $resolver->resolve($filters);
```

### 4. With Relationships

```plaintext
$resolver = new RelationshipResolver($model, $dbOps, $registry);
$filters = Filters::condition('user.profile.status', ComparisonOperator::IS, 'active');
$resolved = $resolver->resolve($filters);
```

## üîç Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Implement `FilterInterface`
- [ ] Create operator enumerations
- [ ] Build core filter classes
- [ ] Implement resolver classes
- [ ] Add factory methods
- [ ] Implement serialization
- [ ] Add resolution logic
- [ ] Create test cases

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

1. **Immutability**

   - Filter objects should be immutable
   - Operations should return new instances
   - Prevent accidental modifications

2. **Type Safety**

   - Validate operator types
   - Check value types
   - Handle null values appropriately

3. **Performance**

   - Optimize resolution process
   - Cache resolved values
   - Minimize object creation

4. **Error Handling**

   - Validate input parameters
   - Handle resolution errors
   - Provide meaningful error messages

5. **Relationship Handling**
   - Validate relationship existence
   - Handle circular references
   - Optimize relationship queries
