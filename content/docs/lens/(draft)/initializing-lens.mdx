Lens operates on data, when we say data, think of it like collection of datum, it's plural.

When we give data to Lens the basic minimum it needs to know:

- Structure of the data (attributes and their types)
- The data itself (You would be supplying the data via an endpoint)

Irrespective of the presentation of the data in whichever style of the view, above both stay same.

You would be providing both information using the top level wrapper called `LensProvider`

```tsx
<LensProvider>

<LensProvider>
```

LensProvider will take care of:

- Querying the data using Tanstack Query
- Supplying data attributes to Views (Each View is responsible to transform, interpret the config)

If "Restaurants" is the data you are going to show, you need to supply with structure which might be:

```
{
    "attributes": {
         "name": {
             "type": "string"
          }
     }
}

```
