## üì° Writing an API for Lens DataTable

To enable the Lens DataTable to fetch and render data correctly, you need to implement a `_read` API endpoint for your data resource. Below are the required guidelines and response structure.

---

### ‚úÖ Endpoint Format

The API should respond to a POST request at the following pattern:

```http
POST /:endpoint/_read
```

- `:endpoint`: is the endpoint defined in the Lens Provider Configuration.

---

### üì• Request Body

The request body is a JSON object structured like this:

```json
{
  "search": "searchTerm",             // Text to be used in free text search
  "pagination": {                       // Used for paginated fetching
    "type": "cursor",
     "per_page": 10, 
     "cursor": 10                      
  },  
  "filters": {
  "op": "and",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "attribute": "locality.name",
      "op": "is_any_of",
      "value": ["locality_1", "locality_5", "locality_3"]
    },
    ......
  ]
}
}
```

---

### üîç Filters Structure

The `filters` key follows a structured object format to support complex, nested filter conditions using logical operators. This enables powerful server-side filtering.

Here‚Äôs the format:

```json
{
  "op": "and",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "attribute": "locality.name",
      "op": "is_any_of",
      "value": ["locality_1", "locality_5", "locality_3"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Keys:

- `op`: Logical operator. Can be `and`, `or`, or `not`.
- `conditions`: An array of filter conditions.
  - `attribute`: The name of the attribute to filter (must match view config keys).
  - `op`: Comparison operator. Examples include:
    - `is`: Equals
    - `is_not`: Not equals
    - `is_any_of`: Attribute matches any in list
    - `contains`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`
    - `greater_than`, `less_than`, etc.
  - `value`: The value or array of values used for filtering.

You can nest conditions by including another filter object inside `conditions`.

```json
{
  "op": "or",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "op": "and",
      "conditions": [
        { "attribute": "state", "op": "is", "value": "Delhi" },
        { "attribute": "district", "op": "is", "value": "North" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "attribute": "city", "op": "contains", "value": "Nagar"
    }
  ]
}
```

This allows filters to be as expressive as needed while staying consistent.

### üì§ Response Structure

The response must return data in the following format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [ /* array of row objects */ ],
  "meta": {
    "count": 2,
    "per_page": 10,
    "has_more": true,
    "next_cursor": 10,
    "prev_cursor": null
  }
}
```

- `data`: Array of row entries.
- `meta`: Controls pagination and is required by the table.
- `next_cursor`: The next starting index for paginated fetch.
- `count`: Total number of records (optional but useful for UX).

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Row Structure

Each object in `data` should contain fields matching the attribute keys in the table configuration, including nested keys if applicable:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid_1",
  "state": "State 1",
  "district": "District 1",
  "cities": "City 1",
  "properties": "Property 1",
  "city": {
    "id": "city_1",
    "name": "City 1",
    "locality": {
      "id": "locality_1",
      "name": "Locality 1",
      "pin": "Pin 1"
    }
  }
}
```

Ensure keys like `city.locality.id` are resolvable from the nested object. This structure supports selection keys and complex URL bindings in actions.

---

### üí° Tips

- **Pagination**: Always respect the `cursor` and return `next_cursor` to support infinite scroll or load-more.
- **Filtering**: Use the `filters` object to dynamically filter data based on selected filter values.
- **Search**: Use the `search` string to match against relevant columns in the dataset.
