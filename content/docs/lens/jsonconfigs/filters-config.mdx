# üîç Simple Filters JSON Configuration

`lensSimpleFilters` provides a declarative way to define filter controls in a Lens-based Datatable. Filters can be based on predefined values (`enum`) or a date range (`date`), and can either be static or dynamically fetched from a related model.

---

## üí° How it Works

Each filter field is configured by specifying a key, type, label, and additional optional behavior like options, model, or dependencies. These filters appear above the datatable and help narrow down results.

### ‚úÖ Example Configuration

```ts
lensSimpleFilters: {
  "state.name": {
    type: "enum",
    label: "States",
    model: "state"
  },
  "district.name": {
    type: "enum",
    label: "District",
    model: "district",
    dependsOn: ["state.name"]
  },
  "city.name": {
    type: "enum",
    label: "City",
    model: "city",
    dependsOn: ["district.name"]
  },
  "locality.name": {
    type: "enum",
    label: "Locality",
    model: "locality",
    dependsOn: ["city.name"]
  },
  "category": {
    type: "enum",
    label: "Category",
    options: [
      { title: "One", const: "One" },
      { title: "Two", const: "Two" },
      { title: "Three", const: "Three" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## üß© Field Reference

### `type` (required)

- Defines the filter type.
- Currently supported: `"enum"` and `"date"`

```ts
type: "enum" // Dropdown
type: "date" // Date picker
```

---

### `label` (required)

- Human-readable name for the filter shown in the UI.

```ts
label: "District"
```

---

### `model` (optional)

- Used when values need to be fetched dynamically.
- The model will be used to make an API call to `_read_relation_options` endpoint.
- The field becomes searchable and paginated.

```ts
model: "district"
```

---

### `options` (optional)

- Used when the values are static and can be provided directly.
- Each option should have:
  - `title`: label shown to the user
  - `const`: the value used in filtering logic

```ts
options: [
  { title: "One", const: "One" },
  { title: "Two", const: "Two" }
]
```

You can use either `model` or `options`, not both.

---

### `dependsOn` (optional)

- Defines dependencies between filters.
- If a parent filter changes, it will reset and refetch the dependent dropdown.

```ts
dependsOn: ["state.name"]
```

This is especially useful in hierarchical relationships (State ‚Üí District ‚Üí City ‚Üí Locality).

---

## üîÑ Filter Chain Example

Here‚Äôs how cascading filters work in practice:

1. **State** is selected.
2. **District** filter repopulates based on selected state.
3. **City** options load based on selected district.
4. **Locality** fetches based on selected city.

This creates a seamless multi-level filter experience.

---

## üìå Notes

- Filters will only show up if added under `lensSimpleFilters`.
- Field keys like `"state.name"` or `"city.name"` can target nested properties via dot notation.
- When `model` is used, the component automatically fetches the options via API.

---

## üß™ Example with Date Filter

```ts
"created_at": {
  type: "date",
  label: "Created Date"
}
```

This adds a simple date range picker that filters based on the `created_at` field.
